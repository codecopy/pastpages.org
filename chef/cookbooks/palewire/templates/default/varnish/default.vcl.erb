    # &_=1234567890, but it changes with each request. This sucks for caching.

    # contain up to 25 other characters EXCEPT for an ampersand.

    # client, all of the other clients will then get the updated response.
    #
    # By setting grace to 5 minutes, we tell Varnish to continue to serve
    # an outdated object for up to 5 minutes past its expiration to cover
    # us while we fetch an updated response. Works great for slow pages.
